=head1 NAME

DBIx::CSSQuery - A Perl DBI extension module to let you fetch data with CSS query syntax.

=head1 VERSION

This document describes DBIx::CSSQuery version 0.03

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use DBIx::CSSQuery;

    # setup
    db->attr(dbh => DBI->connect(...));


    # fetch all posts and do something with them
    db("posts")->each(sub {
        print $_[0]->{body};
    });

    # fetch one post as a hash
    my $post = db("posts[id=1]")->get(0);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

DBIx::CSSQuery is, currently, a proof of concept for what can be done
with CSS query. For example, here's how you retrieve a collection of
a collection of records from table "posts":

    db("posts")

The return value of such expression is an instance of L<DBIx::CSSQuery::Collection>.

Here's how to iterate over thath collection:

    db("posts")->each(sub {
        my $item = shift;

        print $item->{body};
    });

It's also yet-another DBI abstraction layer of Perl module.

=head1 INTERFACE

=over

=item db([ $selector ])

This method is exported to your namespace by default.

If selector is not given, it returns an C<DBIx::CSSQuery::DB>
object. It is required to set dbh attribute on this object before
doing queries. Setting dbh is just thiS:

    db->attr( dbh => DBI->connect($dsn) );

Only after this is done, you may pass $selector into C<db>, do some
query:

    db("posts[id=1]")

At this moment, only very limited selector syntax is
supported. Conceptually, tags are mapped to table names, attributes
are mapped to table columns. So previous query is the same as this sql
query:

    SELECT * FROM posts WHERE id = 1;

Except that it is not executing this sql statement right away, but wait
until it is really required. Laziness is an important virtue in this module.

At this point, if the column type is string, it needs to be
single-quoted, like C<posts[subject='hi']>. If it's integer, it must
not be quoted, like the example above. Hopefully this can be
automatically detected on the backend so the selector syntax an be
less strict.

This function returns an object of L<DBIx::CSSQuery::Collection>, from which
you will manipulate yout retrieved data set.
